        <h2>What I Did This Week</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Studied <em>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja</em> Chapter 9, The Window Object.</li>
            <li>Studied <em>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja</em> Chapter 14, HTML5 APIs.</li>
            <li>
                Completed the <a href="https://byui-cit.github.io/cit261/resources/workflow.html" target="_blank">Managing the modern Front-end workflow exercise</a>.
            </li>
            <li>Prepared for and participated in the Team Activity: Drumkit.</li>
            <li>
                Continued on my <a href="../week14/final/" target="_blank">Poet's Pal app</a> for my final project.  
                Specifically, obtained words that rhyme with the word entered by the user and 
                filtered them by number of syllables.
                More to come.
            </li>
            <li>
                Studied <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions" target="_blank">CSS 
                    transitions in the MDN documentation</a> and the linked pages as well.  This was occasioned by the desire 
                    to better understand the <code>transitionend</code> event introduced by the instructor's solution to 
                    the team activity this week.
            </li>
            <li>
                Experimented with transition properties in the team activity code, especially the
                <code>transition-property</code> property.  I found that we can still see all of the 
                property changes in the <code>playing</code> class even if the <code>transition-property</code>
                is set to just <code>transform</code>.  Doing so spares our app from firing a multitude of
                <code>transitionend</code> and other transition events.  
                This is probably not a significant performance enhancement
                but it was an interesting and informative exercise.

        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                I have been using <code>dataset/data-</code> attributes since Week 5 in the Great Hikes exercises.
                Also in the Star Wars API team activity.
            </li>
            <li>Did drawing with <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> last week.</li>
            <li>We have been using local storage for class assignments for several weeks, now.</li>
            <li>In addition to the <code>transitionend</code> event, I experimented with the 
                <code>ended</code> event for the audio object and the <code>keyup</code> event as well.
                You can see these experiments in the  
                <a href="https://github.com/eolsenbyui/eolsenbyui.github.io/commits/master/wdd330/week09/drums/main.js"
                target="_blank">history for the <code>main.js</code> file on GitHub</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the team activity, since the <code>transition-property</code> for the <code>key</code> class is 
                specified as <code>all</code>, many transitions occur.  The <code>transitionend</code> event is fired
                for each property.  We are not interested in the transitions for most of the properties.  We are 
                interested in the <code>transitionend</code> event for the <code>transform</code> property only.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <code>transform</code> property seems to be consistently the last property to complete the transition
                specified for the <code>key</code> class in the team activity starter code.

        <h2>Comments</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Web Workers are similar to Tasks in C# and threads in C++. 
                I have done these, including synchronization with semaphores and critical sections, since the 1980s.
            </li>
            <li>
                The instructor's solution for the team activity this week hardly scratches the surface for transitions.
                It is useful, however, to understand the <code>transitionend</code> event.
