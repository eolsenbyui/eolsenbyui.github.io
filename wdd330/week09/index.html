        <h2>What I Did This Week</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Studied <em>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja</em> Chapter 9, The Window Object.</li>
            <li>Studied <em>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja</em> Chapter 14, HTML5 APIs.</li>
            <li>
                Completed the <a href="https://byui-cit.github.io/cit261/resources/workflow.html" target="_blank">Managing the modern Front-end workflow exercise</a>.
                <br><img src="images/parcel.jpg" alt="Hello, World!" />
            </li>
            <li>Prepared for and participated in the Team Activity: Drumkit.</li>
            <li>
                Continued on my <a href="../week14/final/" target="_blank">Poet's Pal app</a> for my final project.  
                Specifically, obtained words that rhyme with the word entered by the user and 
                filtered them by number of syllables.  Also got the "nearly rhymes" checkbox in the UI.
                More to come.
            </li>
            <li>
                Studied <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions" target="_blank">CSS 
                    transitions in the MDN documentation</a> and the linked pages as well.  This was occasioned by the desire 
                    to better understand the <code>transitionend</code> event introduced by the instructor's solution to 
                    the team activity this week.
            </li>
            <li>
                Experimented with transition properties in the team activity code, especially the
                <code>transition-property</code> property.  I found that we can still see all of the 
                property changes in the <code>playing</code> class even if the <code>transition-property</code>
                is set to just <code>transform</code>.  Doing so spares our app from firing a multitude of
                <code>transitionend</code> and other transition events.  
                This is probably not a significant performance enhancement
                but it was an interesting and informative exercise.

        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                I have been using <code>dataset/data-</code> attributes since Week 5 in the Great Hikes exercises.
                Also in the Star Wars API team activity.
            </li>
            <li>Did drawing with <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> last week.</li>
            <li>We have been using local storage for class assignments for several weeks, now.</li>
            <li>In addition to the <code>transitionend</code> event, I experimented with the 
                <code>ended</code> event for the audio object and the <code>keyup</code> event as well.
                You can see these experiments in the  
                <a href="https://github.com/eolsenbyui/eolsenbyui.github.io/commits/master/wdd330/week09/drums/main.js"
                target="_blank">history for the <code>main.js</code> file on GitHub</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the team activity, since the <code>transition-property</code> for the <code>key</code> class is 
                specified as <code>all</code>, many transitions occur.  The <code>transitionend</code> event is fired
                for each property.  We are not interested in the transitions for most of the properties.  We are 
                interested in the <code>transitionend</code> event for the <code>transform</code> property only.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <code>transform</code> property seems to be consistently the last property to complete the transition
                specified for the <code>key</code> class in the team activity starter code.

            <li>
                Web Workers are similar to Tasks in C# and threads in C++. 
                I have done these, including synchronization with semaphores and critical sections, since the 1980s.
            </li>

                The Drumkit Team Activity this week seemed "right sized" for an hour.  
                The Thursday Evening team had a great time collaborating on a solution and had time to do the stretch challenges.
            </li>
            <li>
                The instructor's solution for the team activity this week hardly scratches the surface for transitions.
                It is useful, however, to understand the <code>transitionend</code> event.
            </li>
            <li>
                Just as there is no 'i' in the word "team," there is no 'i' in the word "concatenate." 
                The word is misspelled multiple times in 
                the "Managing the Modern Front-End Workflow" unit. It is also spelled correctly once in the unit.
            </li>
            <li>
                I have used this modern workflow for years at work and for personal projects.  I have also used
                full end-to-end DevOps workflows both on-premises and in the cloud.  It's great to push changes 
                to source control and have builds, unit tests, automated acceptance tests, staging, and deployment
                to production just happen automagically.  Then there are containers....
