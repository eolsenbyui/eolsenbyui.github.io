        <h2>What I Did This Week</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Studied <em>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja</em> Chapter 9, The Window Object.</li>
            <li>Studied <em>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja</em> Chapter 14, HTML5 APIs.</li>
            <li>
                Completed the <a href="https://byui-cit.github.io/cit261/resources/workflow.html" target="_blank">Managing the modern Front-end workflow exercise</a>.
            </li>
            <li>Prepared for and participated in the Team Activity: Drumkit.</li>
            <li>
                Continued on my <a href="../week14/final/" target="_blank">Poet's Pal app</a> for my final project.  
                Specifically, obtained words that rhyme with the word entered by the user and 
                filtered them by number of syllables.
                More to come.
            </li>
            <li>
                Studied <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions" target="_blank">transitions 
                    in the MDN documentation</a> and the linked pages as well.  This was occasioned by the desire 
                    to understand the <code>transitionend</code> event introduced by the instructor's solution to 
                    the team activity this week.

        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                I have been using <code>dataset/data-</code> attributes since Week 5 in the Great Hikes exercises.
                Also in the Star Wars API team activity.
            </li>
            <li>Did drawing with <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> last week.</li>
            <li>We have been using local storage for class assignments for several weeks, now.</li>
            <li>In addition to the <code>transitionend</code> event, I experimented with the 
                <code>ended</code> event for the audio object and the <code>keyup</code> event as well.
            </li>

        <h2>Comments</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Web Workers are similar to Tasks in C# and threads in C++. 
                I have done these, including synchronization with semaphores and critical sections, since the 1980s.
            </li>
            <li>
                The instructor's solution for the team activity this week hardly scratches the surface for transitions.
                It is useful, however, to understand the <code>transitionend</code> event.
