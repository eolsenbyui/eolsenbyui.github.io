    <h1>Poet's Pal</h1>
    <div class="subtitle" id="subtitle">
        Final Project Proposal
        <p>Eugene C. Olsen, Section 7, Fall 2021</p>
    </div>

    <section id="purpose">
        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
            The purpose of the <span class="pal">Poet's Pal</span> is to provide a simple one-stop tool for those 
            who desire quick access to literary devices 
            including rhyme, near-rhyme, alliteration, synonyms, and combinations thereof.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <span class="pal">Poet's Pal</span> app is easy to use yet powerful.  The app is more than a rhyming dictionary and thesaurus,
            though it is these things.  The app enables the wordsmith to create targeted search combinations 
            such as "find me a word or words that rhyme with 'kind', begin with the letter 'f', mean 'discover', 
            and have exactly 1 syllable."
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="audience">
        <h2>Audience</h2>
        <p>The audience for the app would include wordsmiths, 
            such as poets and songwriters, who want quick access to the literary devices
            mentioned above.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="data">
        <h2>Data Sources</h2>
        <p>
            The primary data source for the app is the <a href="https://www.datamuse.com/api/" target="_blank">Datamuse API</a>,
            a word-finding query engine for developers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since the Datamuse API can return results that are not safe for work, church, or BYU, a secondary data source 
            is a local JSON file that includes such words, obfuscated by Base64 encoding, to filter these words out of the results.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, the Google fonts "Satisfy" and "Yellowtail" are used in the styling and a marbled background image
            from Unsplash.com by Augustine Wong give a look to the app that is easy on the eyes.
        </p>

        <h2>Appearance and Styling</h2>
        <p>Below are screen shots of a <a href="../../week14/final/" target="_blank">working model of the app</a>
            that show its appearance, components, and styling, including colors and typography.</p>
        <table>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        This is the basic layout of the app with results.
                        <p>"Rhymes with" is self-evident.  The user can enter a word and retrieve a list of words
                            that rhyme with the word entered.  Check the "nearly" checkbox to include near rhymes,
                            as shown below.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Enter one or more letters in the "Starts with" field to find words that alliterate.
                        </p>
                        <p>"Synonymns of" retrieves words that are synonyms of the word entered in the field.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the results list can be filtered by number of syllables, either exactly or
                            less than, as shown below.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Score column in the results indicates how well the word rhymes or how closely 
                            it alliterates or in the case of the synonym, how closely the meanings match.
                        </p>
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <img src="images/results.jpg" />
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        Checking the 'nearly' checkbox directs the app to find words that nearly rhyme with the word entered to its left.
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <img src="images/near_rhyme.jpg" />
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        The last field is a filter that limits the results to words with exactly the specified number of syllables
                        or less than a certain number of syllables, as selected from the drop-down list.  The default is "less than".
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <img src="images/select_syllables.jpg" />
                    </td>
                </tr>
