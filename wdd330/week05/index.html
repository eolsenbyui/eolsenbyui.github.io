                target="_blank">Code snippet</a> demonstrating use of index attribute in the hike list items.
                This simplifies finding a hike in the list greatly and eliminates the need to loop through the hike objects
                array and find a hike by name.

        <h2>What I Did This Week</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Studied <em>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja</em> Chapter 10: Testing and Debugging.</li>
            <li>Studied <em>Eloquent JavaScript</em> Chapter 8: Bugs and Errors.</li>
            <li>Reviewed Jest code I had written over a year ago.</li>
            <li>
                Took a deep dive into the Jest <code>expect</code> methods at 
                <a href="https://jestjs.io/docs/expect" target="_blank">https://jestjs.io/docs/expect</a>.
            </li>
            <li>Prepared for and participated in Team Activity: Great Hikes</li>
            <li>
                Took a deep dive into the

        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Use <code>'use strict'</code> strictly &ndash; er, always.  I've gotten out of the habit.</li>
            <li>I have a love-hate relationship with linting tools.  They do more good than harm and
                save more time than they add frustration, so I continue to use them.</li>

            <li>I believe that it's important to become a debugging ninja.</li>
            <li>The team activity this week was a case of too many cooks in the kitchen.  We got it working, though.</li>
            <li>The team activity is a great prelude to the To-Do List challenge.</li>
            <li>
                The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern is useful in many cases <em>but</em> Microsoft has promoted it 
                as <em>the</em> user interface model since 1992 &mdash; one size must fit all.  First it was the Microsoft
                Foundation Classes in 1992 and then ASP.NET MVC in 2009.  Last Thursday at work I was given an ASP.NET MVC 
                application to fix, written by someone who no longer works there (of course).  It's a miserable piece of code 
                that might have been much simpler without being shoehorned into the MVC pattern.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once again, this week at work I've been coding in Python and C#.  I can't help but think that JavaScript might
                benefit from native assertions like C# has.  Assertions in C and C++ were just macros but in C# they are part
                of the System.Diagnostics library, which comes with the language.
            </li>
            <li>TypeScript is a great idea as JavaScript is so weakly typed but TypeScript is so strongly typed that I've found it difficult to use.</li>
            <li>Creating a class for the sole purpose of encapsulating an array of objects, as was one suggested solution for the 
                team activity this week, is not a common practice in industry.  Despite what I said about the MVC pattern, above,
                the suggested MVC code for the activity, though it introduces an additional level of complexity: the controller, 
                is far better organized than the other suggested solution.
                <p>I think I came up with a simpler solution than either of them: Add a zero-based <code>index</code> attribute to 
                    the displayed list item <code>&lt;li index="0"&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;li index="1"&gt;</code>, etc. for each hike.  
                    Then, when the hike item in the UI is clicked on, grab the index from the list item that was clicked on<br> 
                    <code>let index = event.target.index</code>
                    and index into the hikeList array <code>hikeList[index]</code> and get the hike object we need directly, without the need to 
                    loop through the array and compare names.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                I feel that I'm making good progress toward my personal goal of being able to put together a useful Web UI
                as fast as I can build a Windows desktop UI using WinForms.
