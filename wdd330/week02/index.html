    <h2>What I Did This Week</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Read the assigned material.</li>
      <li>Installed NodeJS and worked with the command line.</li>
      <li>Created a separate stylesheet that can be used for all weekly reports.</li>
      <li>Did the Rainbow exercise from Chapter 1 of N2N</li>
      <li>
        Started the Quiz Ninja exercise from Chapters 1 and 2 of N2N with some modifications.  
        I hate modal popups so I built the welcome message into the page.  I did something different
        for the superhero quiz. See <a href="#comments">Comments</a>, below.
      </li>
      <li>Looked over the To-Do List challenge that's due on Week 7 and have been thinking about approaches to coding it.</li>
      <li>
        Met with team and completed the team assignment <em>and</em> all of the stretch goals for this week.
        We had an enjoyable time and all of us learned something.

    <h2>Plans for Next Week</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Read, read, read about Objects, the DOM, and Events</li>
      <li>
        Find fun and meaningful exercises to do.  I have quite a bit of experience navigating the DOM and have written objects
        and thought in an object-oriented way since the mid-1990s.  Likewise, I've loved events since I understood
        what they were.   That said, I'm always eager to learn something new.  There are lots of JavaScript events
        that I have not yet learned about.
      </li>
      <li>Start writing code for the To-Do List challenge.</li>
      <li>Prepare for and do the team activity.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Comments</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>The mobile first design video strongly recommends against using pop-ups and pop-overs, 
        and N2N's Quiz Ninja asks us to do pop-up prompts and alerts.  I did a conversational NodeJS app instead.
        See <a href="https://github.com/eolsenbyui/eolsenbyui.github.io/blob/master/wdd330/week02/quiz/quiz.js" target="_blank">week02/quiz/quiz.js</a> 
        in the repository.
      </li>
      <li>
        NodeJS doesn't have a native console read function so I wrote one myself.  Node really isn't 
        built to do such things but we found a way to do it.
      </li>
      <li>
        The N2N book talks about commenting code.  I have found, through years of experience,
        that it is better to write clear and understandable code that makes comments unnecessary
        except when the code is doing something that's not easy to understand.  "Causeless comments
        clutter code."
