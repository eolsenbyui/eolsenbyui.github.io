      <li>
        Started the Quiz Ninja exercise from Chapters 1 and 2 of N2N with some modifications.  
        I hate modal popups so I built the welcome message into the page.  I did something different.

    <ol>
      <li>The mobile first design video strongly recommends against using pop-ups and pop-overs, 
        and N2N's Quiz Ninja asks us to do pop-up prompts and alerts.  I did a conversational NodeJS app instead.
        See <a href="https://github.com/eolsenbyui/eolsenbyui.github.io/blob/master/wdd330/week02/quiz/quiz.js" target="_blank">week02/quiz/quiz.js</a> 
        in the repository.

        The N2N book talks about commenting code.  I have found, through years of experience,
        that it is better to write clear and understandable code that makes comments unnecessary
        except when the code is doing something that's not easy to understand.
