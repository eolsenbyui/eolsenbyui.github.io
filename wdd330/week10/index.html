        <h2>Comments</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                The starter code for the Quakes Near Me exercise, even after re-factoring, would not pass a code review at work.  
                The instructions would not pass a requirements review, either.  
                I think this is rather poor for a university with the prestige of BYU.
                If the department needs help cleaning some of these things up, 
                I am willing to volunteer some time between semesters.
