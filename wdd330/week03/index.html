    <h2>What I Did This Week</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Read the assigned material.</li>
      <li>
        Studied the difference between <strong>for..in</strong> and <strong>for..of</strong> loops.  
        The <strong>for..in</strong> loop in Python acts very differently from <strong>for..in</strong> in JavaScript.  
        Likewise, JavaScript's <strong>Array.foreach()</strong> acts very differently from <strong>for each</strong> in C#.
      </li>
      <li>
        Actively participated in the Team Activity.
      </li>
      <li>
        After the team activity, some of my classmates had questions about objects so we did some spontaneous creation
        and manipulation of some objects, starting with the inventors array from the activity and ending by creating
        a car object, with make, model, year, and color properties.  The people who had trouble understanding the
        concepts were the ones writing the code.  They made some wrong turns along the way, but I think that helped 
        to reinforce the concepts once they got their code right.

    <h2>Comments</h2>
    <p></p>
    <ol>
      <li>This week's material began to challenge me a little.</li>
      <li>
        I am working in both C# and Python at work.  It's an interesting challenge to shift back and forth
        between these and JavaScript.  It's a little like taking Spanish, German, and Italian at the same time.
        German takes a large mental shift, but also, Spanish and Italian are similar enough that sometimes 
        one finds one's self speaking Spanish in Italian class and Italian in Spanish class.
