    <h2>What I Did This Week</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Read the assigned material.</li>
      <li>
        Studied the difference between <strong>for..in</strong> and <strong>for..of</strong> loops.  
        The <strong>for..in</strong> loop in Python acts very differently from <strong>for..in</strong> in JavaScript.  
        Likewise, JavaScript's <strong>Array.foreach()</strong> acts very differently from <strong>for each</strong> in C#.
      </li>
      <li>
        Actively participated in the Team Activity.
      </li>
      <li>
        After the team activity, some of my classmates had questions about objects so we did some spontaneous creation
        and manipulation of some objects, starting with the inventors array from the activity and ending by creating
        a car object, with make, model, year, and color properties.  The people who had trouble understanding the
        concepts were the ones writing the code.  They made some wrong turns along the way, but I think that helped 
        to reinforce the concepts once they got their code right.
      </li>
      <li>
        Read chapters 14 and 15 in <em>Eloquent JavaScript</em> and took notes.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Arrow functions have no <code>this</code> pointer.</li>
      <li><code>event.stopPropagation()</code> is kind of like <code>event.preventDefault()</code>.</li>
      <li>
        The childNodes property of an element is a NodeList type, not an array.  
        We can make an array of it by using the <code>Array.from()</code> method if we want to use <code>Array.map(), Array.filter()</code>, etc.
        We can also iterate over it with <code>NodeList.forEach()</code> and <code>for (let child of node.childNodes)</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Element nodes represent HTML tags.  They are type 1 nodes and the JavaScript constant is <code>Node.ELEMENT_NODE</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Text nodes represent text in the HTML document.  They are type 3 nodes.  The JavaScript constant is <code>Node.TEXT_NODE</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Comments are type 8 nodes, <code>Node.COMMENT_NODE</code>.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>To be, or not to be?  <em>That</em> is the question.</li>

    <h2>Comments</h2>
    <p></p>
    <ol>
      <li>This week's material began to challenge me a little.</li>
      <li>
        I am working in both C# and Python at work.  It's an interesting challenge to shift back and forth
        between these and JavaScript.  It's a little like taking Spanish, German, and Italian at the same time.
        German takes a large mental shift, but also, Spanish and Italian are similar enough that sometimes 
        one finds one's self speaking Spanish in Italian class and Italian in Spanish class.
