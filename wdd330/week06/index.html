        <ol>
            <li>While I understand and embrace the concepts of responsive Web design,
                I am still developing CSS skills.  I do well with selectors but still haven't mastered Flex and Grid.
                I have looked up resources on the Web and I look forward to the Advanced CSS course.

                In my professional career, I build functionality first, then add the "eye candy" when 
                the software functions as required.  My employers and customers prefer it that way.

                JavaScript provides a class that encapulates lists of things.  It's called Array.
