      <li>Mixins are an interesting way to work around the lack of multiple inheritance in the language.</li>

        As of version 13.2.0, NodeJS supports ECMAScript modules and the <code>import</code> statement in addition 
        to the familiar NodeJS <code>require</code> function.  The current stable version of NodeJS is 14.18.0.
      </li>
      <li>
        The current <a href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/">ECMAScript 2022 language specification</a> includes truly 
        <a href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/#prod-PrivateIdentifier" target="_blank"> private identifiers</a>.
        Prefixing an identifier with a hash character ('#') makes it private.
        When released next year, this will give us private methods and member variables in classes.  Yay!

      <li>Great discussion on iterators in <em>Eloquent JavaScript</em>!</li>
      <li>
        Haverbeke, in <em>Eloquent JavaScript</em>, describes tangled code as a "big ball of mud,"
        which is an apt visual.
        Throughout my career, I have heard the metaphor "bowl of spaghetti" used to describe disorganized code.
        Several years ago, a mid-level software engineer created such a monster where I was working at the time.
        I was a software test manager at that time.  (Some people call software testing "quality assurance")
        but I think that is a misnomer:  Testers cannot <em>assure</em> quality though they can help improve it,
        and besides, quality is <em>everyone's</em> job, not just the testers.)
        When my test engineers would report a bug, he would fix the bug
        but create 5 or 6 more in the process of fixing the one bug.  After a couple of weeks of this,
        the development was turned over to a principal software engineer, who re-designed the whole thing 
        from the ground up and 
        had it running in a few days, with an occasional and isolated bug here and there, which was quickly fixed
        and had no side-effects.  The principal engineer's approach was to identify the discrete components first,
        then design the interfaces, and then implement them in classes.

    <ol>
      <li>
        Haverbeke claims, in <em>Eloquent JavaScript</em>, Chapter 6, that inheritance creates "more tangle." 
        Twenty-seven years of software development with classes and objects, incluing inheritance and multiple
        inheritance, tell me that this is not necessarily so.  Thoughtfully designed inheritance structures
        need not be tangled at all but rather, can be clean and clear.   I have seen programmers break
        encapulation and make a mess of polymorphism, just as I have seen programmers abuse inheritance.
        I might accept the argument that inheritance may be easier to abuse than encapsulation and polymorphism
        but cannot agree with the author that inheritance inherently creates "more tangle."
        I do agree with the author, however, that we probably shouldn't actively go looking for opportunities
        to construct class hierarchies.  The need for such will usually be obvious, if not painfully so.

        I was disappointed to discover that JavaScript does not support <em>operator overloading.</em>  There is a
        <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-operator-overloading" target="_blank">formal proposal</a> 
        to add the feature but it is not included in the <a href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/" target="_blank">
        ECMSScript 2022 Language Specification</a>.  Maybe next time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Maybe some future version of ECMAScript will offer direct multiple inheritance.
        Most serious object-oriented languages have that feature.
        The <a
          href="https://medium.com/geekculture/proposals-included-in-the-incoming-ecmascript-2022-standard-for-javascript-6119a4518904"
          target="_blank">
          proposal for ECMAScript 2022</a> does not include multiple inheritance.
        Nor does the <a href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/" target="_blank">
          ECMSScript 2022 Language Specification</a>.

        Tic-Tac-Toe seems to be a popular exercise for programming classes and tutorials.  I have done several.
        The instructor's version of the exercise is the most concise that I've seen to date.
      </li>
      <li>I wish I had time to do <em>all</em> of the exercises in <em>Eloquent JavaScript.</em></li>
