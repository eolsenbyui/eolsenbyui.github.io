    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Mixins are an interesting way to work around the lack of multiple inheritance in the language.</li>
      <li>
        As of version 13.2.0, NodeJS supports ECMAScript modules and the <code>import</code> statement in addition 
        to the familiar NodeJS <code>require</code> function.  The current stable version of NodeJS is 14.18.0.
      </li>
      <li>
        The current <a href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/">ECMAScript 2022 language specification</a> includes truly 
        <a href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/#prod-PrivateIdentifier" target="_blank"> private identifiers</a>.
        Prefixing an identifier with a hash character ('#') makes it private.
        When released next year, this will give us private methods and member variables in classes.  Yay!

        Maybe some future version of ECMAScript will offer direct multiple inheritance.
        Most serious object-oriented languages have that feature.
        The <a
          href="https://medium.com/geekculture/proposals-included-in-the-incoming-ecmascript-2022-standard-for-javascript-6119a4518904"
          target="_blank">
          proposal for ECMAScript 2022
        </a> does not include multiple inheritance.
        Nor does the <a href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/" target="_blank">
          ECMSScript 2022 Language Specification
        </a>.

        Tic-Tac-Toe seems to be a popular exercise for programming classes and tutorials.  I have done several.
        The instructor's version of the exercise is the most concise that I've seen to date.
