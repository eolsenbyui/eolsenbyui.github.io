    <p><em>
        Tzu-li and Tzu-ssu were boasting about the size of their latest programs. 
        ‘Two-hundred thousand lines,’ said Tzu-li, ‘not counting comments!’ Tzu-ssu responded, 
        ‘Pssh, mine is almost a million lines already.’<br>
        Master Yuan-Ma said, ‘My best program has five hundred lines.’ 
        Hearing this, Tzu-li and Tzu-ssu were enlightened.<br><br>

        <h2>Description of the Poet's Pal</h2>
        <p>
            Poet's Pal is a small, mobile-friendly one-stop Web app for the discovery of
            basic literary devices based on specific criteria, such as rhyme, alliteration, and synonyms,
            for use by poets, songwriters, and other wordsmiths.
            It is more than just a rhyming dictionary and thesaurus, though it is these things; it uniquely allows the
            user to search by combinations of these devices and limit the results by the number of syllables &mdash;
            a handy feature when the wordsmith has a specific number or range of syllables to work with.
        </p>
        <p>
            The user interface of the Poet's Pal has two sections:
            <ol>
                <li>A form for entering search criteria:</li>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>A word to rhyme with.</li>
                    <li>Words that begin with a letter or letters, useful in building alliteration and other similar devices.</li>
                    <li>Synonyms of a word.</li>
                    <li>Any combination of the above.</li>
                    <li>Optional limiting of the results to a specific number or range of syllables.</li>
                </ol>
                <li>
                    A table for displaying the search's results.  Results are limited to 50 
                    words that rhyme "perfectly" with the addition of up to 50 imperfect rhymes.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            The search engine for the Poet's Pal is the <a href="https://www.datamuse.com/api/" target="_blank">Datamuse API</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>How to Use the Poet's Pal</h2>
        <p>
            The Poet's Pal is a Web app that is mobile-friendly in portrait mode.
            The upper part of the user interface is a form with four input fields, 
            as shown below:
        </p>
        <img src="images/poetspal.jpg" alt="Full form">
        <p>
            As seen in the example above, you can fill in any or all of the input fields.
            You can then click or tap the Submit button or press the Enter key and the
            app will search for the criteria entered and display any results in a table 
            below the submit button.
        </p>
        <p>
            Options for syllable selection are "less than" and "exactly", selectable 
            in the drop-down list to the right of the word "and" in the last line of
            input fields.  <strong>Note:</strong> Since the number of syllables is
            returned only when rhyming is involved, the "syllable" fields are disabled
            when nothing is entered in the "Rhymes with" field.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, tapping or clicking the Clear button will clear all of the fields and help 
            you start with a clean slate.
        </p>

        <h2>CSS Features Employed</h2>
        <p></p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>:root</code> to define common values in variables.</li>
            <li>
                Defined a basic font size in the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag.  All other 
                sizes are defined in <code>em</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
                One simple <code>@media</code> query that shrinks the elements for smaller screens.
                Since all sizes are in <code>em</code>, only one simple media query was needed.
                All controls and fonts shrink proportionally for smaller screens.
            </li>
            <li>
                Styles for sizing and positioning input fields and their labels.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use of <code>tr:nth-child(even)</code> to provide subtle striping for ease of reading
                the results table.
            </li>
            <li>
                Choice of fonts to give input fields, buttons, footer credits, and results table headers a "retro" look.
                Also, rounded corners in the input fields and buttons reinforce the look.
            </li>
            <li>
                Position the <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> at the very bottom of the screen regardless of 
                the vertical screen size.
            </li>
            <li>Provide an attractive marbled background image.</li>
            <li>
                Employed <code>:first-of-type</code>, <code>:last-of-type</code>, <code>:first-child</code>,
                and <code>:last-child</code> to provide justification and padding to enhance the readability
                of the results.
            </li>
            <li>Used <code>class="hidden"</code> with <code>display: none;</code> to selectively hide elements as needed.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>The Design Process</h2>
        <p>
            In the Master Mobile UX video, assigned in Week 1 of this WDD330 course, 
            we learned about designing mobile-first.  
            At about the same time, at work, we had built a Web app for Cisco Systems
            and they asked us to make it "mobile-friendly" after the fact.  I found first-hand that
            it is much easier to design mobile-first than to take an app designed
            for tablet or Web and make it mobile-friendly later.
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore, as I began to write proof-of-concept UI code for the Poet's Pal, I did so 
            using the device tools in Chrome.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the major design goals has been to keep the app simple. 
            There is always the temptation to make things more complex.  
            Sometimes I resisted the temptation to add more "whistles and bells" and sometimes I did not.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Original Concept and Final Implementation</h2>
        <p>
            The final implementation of the Poet's Pal varies only in small details from the original concept.
            The final result matches the original concept in every major respect.   
        </p>
        <p>
            One exception to this is the handling of imperfect rhymes, also known as "near-rhymes."
            Originally, the app
            displayed a checkbox to the right of the "Rhymes with" input field with a label that said 
            "nearly" to the right of the checkbox, as shown below:
        </p>
        <img src="images/formfull.JPG" alt="Full form">
        <p>
            Usability testing with friends and 
            family showed this to be confusing.  One of my sons suggested that I display perfect as well as 
            any imperfect rhymes and just dislpay the words that rhyme imperfectly in <em>italics.</em>  
        </p>
        <p>
            In the final delivery of the app, the checkbox and its label have been removed
            and perfect rhymes are displayed first in the results table,
            followed by the list of imperfect rhymes.  Again, all words that are deemed by the API
            to rhyme imperfectly are <em>italicized.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Datamuse API is easy to use in its raw form but the output JSON is unformatted.  
            It is easy to enter the url and query parameters for the Datamuse API in the address bar
            of a browser and get the results on a Web page.
            The Poet's Pal was conceptualized to make input even easier and intuitive, and the output readable.
            The final implementation of the Poet's Pal achieves these goals.
        </p>

        <h2>Challenges and Resolutions</h2>
        <p>
            The Datamuse API is easy to use and there were few challenges.  The couple of challenges
            I did encounter were related to CSS and styling.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Positioning the "nearly" checkbox and its label.</li>
            <li>The results table underlapped the footer.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Resolutions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Successfully used the <code>float: left</code> style for the "nearly" checkbox and its label.
                Then usability testing showed that the checkbox was confusing, so it was ultimately discarded
                and near rhymes are always requested when a rhyme is requested.  Perfect rhymes are displayed
                first, followed by imperfect or "near" rhymes.  
                Words that rhyme imperfectly are displayed in <em>italics.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
                The footer is now hidden when results are displayed.  Its visibility is restored when the Clear button is
                tapped or clicked.  The author hopes that the user is more interested in the results than 
                in the credits in the footer.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Application of Topics from WDD330</h2>
        <p></p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The RESTful <code>fetch()</code> call to the Datamuse API was taken nearly verbatim from
                the Week 11 <code>getJSON()</code> starter code for the JWT Team Activity, with the addition
                of the <code>throw</code> from the modified <code>makeRequest()</code> function.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mobile-first design from Week 1.
            </li>
            <li>
                Separation of concerns and a quasi-model-view-controller (MVC) architecture.
            </li>
            <li>Used a "hidden" class to selectively display and hide elements as we did in Week ?</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
