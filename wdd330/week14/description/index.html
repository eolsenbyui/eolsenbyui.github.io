        Tzu-li and Tzu-ssu were boasting about the size of their latest programs. 
        ‘Two-hundred thousand lines,’ said Tzu-li, ‘not counting comments!’ Tzu-ssu responded, 
        ‘Pssh, mine is almost a million lines already.’<br>
        Master Yuan-Ma said, ‘My best program has five hundred lines.’ 
        Hearing this, Tzu-li and Tzu-ssu were enlightened.<br><br>

        <p>Like Master Yuan-Ma's best program, my final project, Poet's Pal, has about 500 lines of code.</p>

        <h2>The Design Process</h2>
        <p>
            In the Master Mobile UX video, assigned in Week 1 of this WDD330 course, 
            we learned about designing mobile-first.  
            At about the same time, at work, we had built an app for Cisco Systems
            and they asked us to make it "mobile-friendly."  I found first-hand that
            it is much easier to design mobile-first than to take an app designed
            for tablet or Web and make it mobile-friendly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore, as I began to write proof-of-concept UI code for the Poet's Pal, I did so 
            using the device tools in Chrome.
