        Tzu-li and Tzu-ssu were boasting about the size of their latest programs. 
        ‘Two-hundred thousand lines,’ said Tzu-li, ‘not counting comments!’ Tzu-ssu responded, 
        ‘Pssh, mine is almost a million lines already.’<br>
        Master Yuan-Ma said, ‘My best program has five hundred lines.’ 
        Hearing this, Tzu-li and Tzu-ssu were enlightened.<br><br>

        <p>Like Master Yuan-Ma's best program, my final project, Poet's Pal, has about 500 lines of code.</p>

        <h2>Description of the Poet's Pal</h2>
        <p>
            Poet's Pal is a small, mobile-friendly one-stop Web app for the discovery of
            basic literary devices based on specific criteria, such as rhyme, alliteration, and synonyms,
            for use by poets, songwriters, and other wordsmiths.
            It is more than just a rhyming dictionary and thesaurus, though it is these things; it uniquely allows the
            user to search by combinations of these devices and limit the results by the number of syllables &mdash;
            a handy feature when the wordsmith has a specific number or range of syllables to work with.
        </p>
        <p>
            The user interface of the Poet's Pal has two sections:
            <ol>
                <li>A form for entering search criteria:</li>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>A word to rhyme with.</li>
                    <li>Words that begin with a letter or letters.</li>
                    <li>Synonyms of a word.</li>
                    <li>Any combination of the above.</li>
                    <li>Optional limiting of the results to a specific number or range of syllables.</li>
                </ol>
                <li>A table for displaying the search's results.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            The search engine for the Poet's Pal is the <a href="https://www.datamuse.com/api/" target="_blank">Datamuse API</a>.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>How to Use the Poet's Pal</h2>
        <p>
            The Poet's Pal is a Web app that is mobile-friendly in portrait mode.
            The upper part of the user interface is a form with four input fields, 
            as shown below:
        </p>
        <img src="images/formfull.JPG" alt="Full form">
        <p>
            As seen in the example above, you can fill in any or all of the input fields.
            You can then click or tap the Submit button or press the Enter key and the
            app will search for the criteria entered and display any results in a table 
            below the submit button.
        </p>
        <p>
            Options for syllable selection are "less than" and "exactly", selectable 
            in the drop-down list to the right of the word "and" in the last line of
            input fields.  <strong>Note:</strong> Since the number of syllables is
            returned only when rhyming is involved, the "syllable" fields are disabled
            when nothing is entered in the "Rhymes with" field.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also search for near-rhymes by checking the checkbox between the 
            rhyme entry field and the "nearly" label.  Note that the "near rhyme" feature
            of the Datamuse API seems to be under development.  Many words return no near
            rhymes but the feature is available for those words that do return a good
            number of near rhymes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, tapping or clicking the Clear button will clear all of the fields and help 
            you start with a clean slate.
        </p>

        <h2>CSS Features Employed</h2>
        <p></p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>:root</code> to define common values in variables.</li>
            <li>
                Defined a basic font size in the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag.  All other 
                sizes are defined in <code>em</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
                One simple <code>@media</code> query that shrinks the elements for smaller screens.
                Since all sizes are in <code>em</code>, only one simple media query was needed.
                All controls and fonts shrink proportionally for smaller screens.
            </li>
            <li>
                Styles for sizing and positioning input fields and their labels.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use of <code>tr:nth-child(even)</code> to provide subtle striping for ease of reading
                the results table.
            </li>
            <li>
                Choice of fonts to give input fields, buttons, footer credits, and results table headers a "retro" look.
                Also, rounded corners in the input fields and buttons reinforce the look.
            </li>
            <li>
                Position the <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> at the very bottom of the screen regardless of 
                the vertical screen size.
            </li>
            <li>Provide an attractive marbled background image.</li>
            <li>
                Used <code>float: left</code> to coerce the near-rhyme checkbox and label to the very
                left of their table data cell in order to be close to the rhyme input field.
            </li>
            <li>
                Employed <code>:first-of-type</code>, <code>:last-of-type</code>, <code>:first-child</code>,
                and <code>:last-child</code> to provide justification and padding to enhance the readability
                of the results.
            </li>
            <li>Used <code>class="hidden"</code> with <code>display: none;</code> to selectively hide elements as needed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Design Process</h2>
        <p>
            In the Master Mobile UX video, assigned in Week 1 of this WDD330 course, 
            we learned about designing mobile-first.  
            At about the same time, at work, we had built an app for Cisco Systems
            and they asked us to make it "mobile-friendly."  I found first-hand that
            it is much easier to design mobile-first than to take an app designed
            for tablet or Web and make it mobile-friendly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore, as I began to write proof-of-concept UI code for the Poet's Pal, I did so 
            using the device tools in Chrome.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the major design goals has been to keep the app simple. 
            There is always the temptation to make things more complex.  
            Sometimes I resisted the temptation to add more "whistles and bells" and sometimes I did not.
        </p>

        <h2>Original Concept and Final Implementation</h2>
        <p>
            The final implementation of the Poet's Pal varies only in small details from the original concept.
            The final result matches the original concept in every major respect.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Datamuse API is easy to use in its raw form but the output JSON is unformatted.  
            It is easy to enter the url and query parameters for the Datamuse API in the address bar
            of a browser and get the results on a Web page.
            The Poet's Pal was conceptualized to make input even easier and intuitive, and the output readable.
            The final implementation of the Poet's Pal achieves these goals.

        <h2>Application of Topics from WDD330</h2>
        <p></p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The RESTful <code>fetch()</code> call to the Datamuse API was taken nearly verbatim from
                the Week 11 <code>getJSON()</code> starter code for the JWT Team Activity, with the addition
                of the <code>throw</code> from the modified <code>makeRequest()</code> function.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mobile-first design from Week 1.
            </li>
            <li>
                Separation of concerns and a quasi-model-view-controller architecture.
            </li>
            <li>Used a "hidden" class to selectively display and hide elements as we did in Week ?</li>
