        <h2>Web Page Exercises and Experiments</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                My <a href="https://github.com/eolsenbyui/eolsenbyui.github.io/tree/master/wdd330/week11" target="_blank">server and client code</a> 
                for the JWT activity.

                Progress on final project: <a href="../week14/final/" target="_blank">Poet's Pal</a>.

        <h2>What I Did This Week</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepared for and participated in the JWT Team Activity.</li>
            <li>
                Showed my team how to use <a href="https://www.postman.com/" target="_blank">Postman</a>
                to exercise and test RESTful APIs.
            </li>
            <li>Helped Jesse Wilson individually debug his version of the JWT code.</li>
            <li>
                Modified my JWT code to use Basic Authentication for the Login to avoid sending credentials
                in clear text "across the wire."   This may seem silly when both client and server are on localhost
                using HTTP protocol but it's a very bad habit to send credentials in clear text.
            </li>
            <li>
                Continued on the <a href="../week14/final/" target="_blank">Poet's Pal app</a> for my final project.  
                Specifically, 
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Split out API-related code into model.js</li>
                    <li>Split out display-related code into view.js</li>
                    <li>Fixed results table header code to be responsive to different return list types.</li>
                    <li>
                        Disable the "number of syllables" filter UI when no word to rhyme is 
                        specified, as the Datamuse API does not return the number of syllables unless
                        rhyming is involved.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Wrote a small node.js app to base64 encode Zac Anger's 
                        <a href="https://github.com/zacanger/profane-words#readme" target="_blank">Profane Words list</a>
                        so that I didn't need to construct my own or look at offensive words myself.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Filter results from the Datamuse API through the offensive words list so as not to display
                        offensive or profane words in the result set.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Kept up with the team activity and final project despite battling COVID-19.  
                The long holiday weekend helped a great deal.
            </li>
            <li>
                Took a deeper dive into the Model-View-Controller pattern for JavaScript,
                including Inversion of Control (IoC), which I have done for years in C#, and
                function binding, which I have done using the React framework in the past.  
                At least some of this (though not React) will find its way into my final project.
            </li>
            <li>
                Studied the "Layouts" chapter of 
                <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/css-master-3rd-edition/" target="_blank"><em>CSS Master</em>, 3rd Edition</a>
                by Tiffany Brown in preparation for next week's styling of my final project. "Everything is a box."
            </li>

                The instructor's solution to the JWT team exercise was clear and enlightening.
