                My <a href="https://github.com/eolsenbyui/eolsenbyui.github.io/tree/master/wdd330/week11" target="_blank">server and client code</a>

        <h2>What I Did This Week</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepared for and participated in the JWT Team Activity.</li>
            <li>
                Modified my JWT code to use Basic Authentication for the Login to avoid sending credentials
                in clear text "across the wire."   This may seem silly when the client is on localhost
                using HTTP protocol but it's a very bad habit to send credentials in clear text.
            </li>
            <li>
                Continued on my <a href="../week14/final/" target="_blank">Poet's Pal app</a> for my final project.  
                Specifically, 
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Split out API-related code into model.js</li>
                    <li>Fixed table header code to be responsive to different return list types.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Plans for Next Week</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Complete the Team activity, with my team and individually.</li>
            <li>
                Continue work on my final project.  Specifically: 
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Implement media queries.</li>
                    <li>Improve styling.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Keeping up with the team activity and final project despite battling COVID-19.
            </li>
            <li>
                Took a deeper dive into the Model-View-Controller pattern for JavaScript,
                including Inversion of Control (IoC), which I have done for years in C#, and
                function binding, which I have done using the React framework in the past.  
                At least some of this (though not React) will find its way into my final project.
            </li>
