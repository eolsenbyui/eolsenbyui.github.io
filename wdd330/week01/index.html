    <h2>What I Did This Week</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Dropped CS 213 and added WDD 330 on Thursday 16 September 2021.  Thank you, <strong>Brother James</strong>, for your help with this!</li>
      <li>Purchased SitePoint license and logged in.</li>
      <li>Read the course Syllabus.</li>
      <li>Read the Local Storage section of <em>Doing Stuff With Web Things</em> and did the exercises.</li>
      <li>Looked through the rest of <em>Doing Stuff With Web Things.</em>  Yes, it's review but review doesn't hurt.
      It's been a few weeks since I've built Web pages at work.  I've been deep into Python and Microsoft's Power platform. 
      The transition back to JavaScript has taken effort, but rewarding effort.</li>
      <li>Created a portfolio on GitHub at <a href="https://eolsenbyui.github.io/wdd330/" target="_blank">https://eolsenbyui.github.io/wdd330/</a></li>
      <li>Completed the <em>Master Mobile UX</em> videos and took three pages of notes.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Plans for Next Week</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>I look forward to meeting with my team.</li>
      <li>Review JavaScript variables, scope, converting/parsing, template literals, arrays, logic, and loops.</li>
      <li>Review JavaScript functions. (I usually prefer coding with "arrow" functions, though not always.)</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <p>None at this time.  It's not that I'm not curious; rather, I tend to dig and find my own answers.</p>
