                Final project, <a href="../week14/final/" target="_blank">Poet's Pal</a>, is 
                code complete. 
                Here's the <a href="https://github.com/eolsenbyui/eolsenbyui.github.io/tree/master/wdd330/week14/final" target="_blank">code</a>.
                Code hardening and final testing are in progress.
                Late-breaking bugs may be fixed.

        <h2>What I Did This Week</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Finalized work on the <a href="../week14/final/" target="_blank">Poet's Pal app</a> for my final project.  
                Specifically:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Thorough functional and usability testing including friends and family members as testers.</li>
                    <li>
                        Removed the "nearly" checkbox and label as usability testing showed that these confused
                        most users.  Now I just get both the perfect and imperfect (aka "near") rhymes
                        and display them.  This makes for 2 calls to the API for rhymes but most API calls respond in 
                        less than 70 milliseconds.
                    </li>
                    <li>Fixed minor bugs.</li>
                    <li>Improved styling incrementally.</li>
                    <li>
                        Added credit for the Datamuse API.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                Completed the required <a href="../week14/description/" target="_blank">Functional Description</a>
                writeup for the project.

        <h2>Plans for Next Week</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Fix any serious late-emerging bugs.</li>
            <li>Review documentation and make any needed improvements.</li>
            <li>
                Turn in the project!

        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Had family and friends test the app and conducted an informal usability study, also with family and friends.
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Uncovered a few bugs, which I fixed.</li>
                    <li>
                        It became very clear, early on, that the "nearly" checkbox to the right of the "Rhymes with" input 
                        field was more confusing than helpful.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Demographic: Every adult female tester (including one transgender born female) asked what the score in the results means.  
                        Not one of the male testers even mentioned it.  Every online rhyming dictionary 
                        I've seen has some sort of scoring mechanism to indicate how well a result word rhymes
                        with the search word.  The same applies for synonyms, etc. in the Datamuse API.
                        There were five female testers, including one teen, and 5 male testers, all adults.
                    </li>
                    <li>The most-requested feature is to add searching for antonyms.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                There is a <a href="../week14/description/#grading" target="_blank">map of Grading Rubrics to Code</a> 
                in the <a href="../week14/description/" target="_blank">Functional Description</a> document
                to help the instructor with grading.  The map contains a section for each grading rubric, with subsections
                as needed, and points to the code at the module, function, method, and event handler level.

            <li>
                <strong>Don't shake the Jell-O!</strong>  When software is almost ready to release, keep changes small.
                Each change, no matter how minor, shakes the Jell-O and it takes a while for Jell-O to 
                stop shaking.

                Two of my daughters have already used the Poet's Pal for school assignments!
