        <h2>Web Page Exercises and Experiments</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Progress on final project: <a href="../week14/final/" target="_blank">Poet's Pal</a>. 
                Here's the <a href="https://github.com/eolsenbyui/eolsenbyui.github.io/tree/master/wdd330/week14/final" target="_blank">code</a>.
                See specific tasks completed in <a href="#accomplishments">What I Did This Week</a>, below.
           </li>
           <li>
               Experimented with <a href="../week12/flex/" target="_blank">Flex layout</a>.  
               Not much to look at.  The benefit was in the tweaking of styles and looking at the results.
               Here's the <a href="https://github.com/eolsenbyui/eolsenbyui.github.io/tree/master/wdd330/week12/flex" target="_blank">code</a>.
           </li>
           <li>
            Experimented with <a href="../week12/grid/" target="_blank">Grid layout</a>.  
            Again, not a whole lot to look at.  The benefit was in the tweaking of styles and looking at the results.

        <h2>What I Did This Week</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepared for and participated in the "Final Project Show and Tell" Team Activity.</li>
            <li>
                Continued on the <a href="../week14/final/" target="_blank">Poet's Pal app</a> for my final project.  
                Specifically:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>
                        Added a media query to adjust styling for smaller screens.
                        Because all font and control sizes are in <code>em</code>, there was not too much work to do here.
                    </li>
                    <li>Added a Clear button for users to clear input and results.</li>
                    <li>Added a <code>div</code> for informational messages, above the results table.</li>
                    <li>Display the number of results in the informational message area.</li>
                    <li>
                        Various styling improvements.
                    </li>
                    <li>Small bug fixes.</li>
                    <li>
                        Added credit to Zac Anger for profane words list used in the filter.
                    </li>
                    <li>Began the required functional description write-up for submission of the final project.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                Experimented with both Flex and Grid layouts, specifically to prevent the results table
                in my final project from displaying under the fixed footer. 
                I have been able to do this using Bootstrap but failed to do it with just HTML and CSS.
                Still, the experimenting was enlightening on the use of Flex and Grid.

                Continue work on my final project.  Specifically: 
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Thorough functional and usability testing including friends and family members as testers.</li>
                    <li>Fix any bugs and usability issues.</li>
                    <li>Improve styling as needed.</li>
                    <li>Complete the required functional description write-up for the project.</li>

        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Continued to study layout in
                <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/css-master-3rd-edition/" target="_blank"><em>CSS Master</em>, 3rd Edition</a>
                by Tiffany Brown, specifically to address the layout issue noted above.
            </li>
            <li>
                Also studied media queries in the same book, which helped me a great deal.
                After a good deal of experimenting, trial, and error,
                the final result in my project is simpler than I had originally expected.  Simple is good! üëç
            </li>
            <li>
                Discovered how to use emojis ‚ú® in HTML.

                Each team member's final project looked sharp!  
                Everyone made meaningful and helpful suggestions to other team members. 
                It was a fun team activity this week. üôÇ
