        <h2>Web Page Exercises and Experiments</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Worked the 
                <a href="ajax" target="_blank">AJAX example</a> in <em>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja</em> Chapter 13, AJAX.
                Refactored the promise logic to <code>async/await</code>.

                My concept of the <a href="hikes" target="_blank">Great Hikes</a> team exercise solution
                using local storage for the comments.

        <h2>Plans for Next Week</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Study <em>HTML5 and CSS3 for the Real World</em> Chapter 8, Transforms and Transitions</li>
            <li>Study <em>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja</em> Chapter 12, Canavs, SVG, and Drag and Drop</li>
            <li>Prepare for and participate in the Team Activity</li>
            <li>Start designing and writing proof-of-concept code for my final project.
                I'm trying to decide between a weather app, using one of the public weather APIs, 
                and a poet's helper app assisting with rhyme, syllables, and "sounds like,"
                "means the same as," and other such AI functions using the 
                <a href="https://www.datamuse.com/api/" target="_blank">Datamuse API</a>.

        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <em>functionname</em><code>.call()</code> passes a <code>this</code> pointer to the first argument
                passed to <code>.call</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <code>.apply</code> method works the same way but the arguments after the first are in an array.
            </li>
            <li>
                Properties can be added to functions.  Functions in JavaScript are objects, not merely pointers to code.
            </li>
            <li>
                Properties are lost if a function redefines itself.
            </li>
            <li>
                Memoization: cached results.  I can see uses for this.  I could use this in my current Python project at work, 
                and lo, I find that Python 3.2+ supports it natively.
            </li>
            <li>
                IIFE ("iffy") functions.  Clever but easier to accomplish in ES6 with code blocks as in C/C++ or C#.
            </li>
            <li>
                XMLHttpRequest has been superseded by the Fetch API.  The Fetch API is a "living standard."
                The Fetch API uses promises.  The <code>fetch()</code> method can also be used with <code>async/await</code>.
                See instructions on how to do so <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Async_await#rewriting_promise_code_with_asyncawait" target="_blank">here</a> 
                and <a href="https://dmitripavlutin.com/javascript-fetch-async-await/" target="_blank">here</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <code>.json()</code> method is the most common of AJAX responses.  
                The <code>.redirect()</code> method is not supported in any browser.

        <ol>
            <li>
                The <em>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja</em> book isn't my favorite but I've got to say that its
                explanation of promises is very good.
            </li>
            <li>
                Promises are great but <code>async/await</code> makes for clearer, easier-to-understand code.
            </li>
            <li>
                I have been using AJAX for years without knowing it.
